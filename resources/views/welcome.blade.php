                Christian marriage is a solemn and public covenant between a man and a woman in the presence of God,
                intended by God for their mutual joy; for the help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity;
                and, when it is God's will, for the procreation of children and their nurture.

                        <p class="pt-4 font-sans text-lg text-gray-800 ">
                            The biblical account of marriage begins in Genesis 1:27, with the creation of man in two sexes:
                            “God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created
                            them. And God blessed them.” And Genesis 2:24 explains, “For this reason a man shall leave his father
                            and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.” Jesus later called humanity
                            back to these truths (Matt. 19:4–6; Mark 10:6–8), and the Christian story of the world is viewed as
                            culminating in the wedding of Christ and his bride, the Church. All Christian discussions of marriage
                             stem from this “great mystery,” as Paul called it (Eph. 5:32).
                        </p>
                        <p class="pt-4 font-sans text-lg text-gray-800 ">
                            Hence, in Christianity, marriage is a sacred union of the highest order.
                            Although Martin Luther, in praising marriage as “pleasing to God and precious
                            in his sight,” also declared that “weddings and marriage are worldly [i.e.,
                             secular] affairs,” almost all Christians have continued to regard marriage as
                              sacred.
